# The Planes
**Explore the possibilities of planes**  
The project realizes the capabilities of parallel plane transfer and plane rotation


### Brief information:
- Language: Russian only
- Engine: Unity 6000.0.26f1
- Done in one day
- Used [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) (Wanted to try what it is)


### Capabilities:
- Create lines, points or pre-made shapes in a couple of clicks
- Perform parallel transfer of all objects you have created to any vector
- Rotate the entire plane around any point and at any angle
- Undo all your actions (with Ctrl+Z)

#### Other
Fun fact: In version 1.1.0, I added the ability to undo changes. Since my feature uses the same keyboard shortcut as Unity, it causes a conflict in the engine itself and you can accidentally undo an action and object creation in one click
